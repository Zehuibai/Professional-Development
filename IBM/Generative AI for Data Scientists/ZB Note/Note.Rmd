# Prompt Engineering Basics

## Prompt Engineering

**Prompt engineering, in one sentence**
Designing and iteratively refining instructions (prompts) so a generative AI model produces responses that are relevant, accurate, safe, and in the exact format you need.

**Why it matters for generative AI**

* Improves relevance and specificity by giving the model clear goals, constraints, and context.
* Reduces common failure modes (vagueness, omissions, hallucinations) by steering scope and format.
* Boosts task performance without retraining the model—prompt quality acts like “runtime fine-tuning.”
* Enhances safety by avoiding harmful or ambiguous instructions and by asking for sources, checks, or disclaimers.

**The core workflow (an iterative loop)**

1. Define the objective

   * Be explicit about what you want, for whom, and why.
   * Example objective: “Summarize benefits and risks of using AI in automobiles for a non-technical audience.”

2. Draft an initial prompt

   * A clear instruction or question aligned to the objective.
   * Example: “Write an essay analyzing the pros and cons of integrating AI into the automotive industry.”

3. Test and inspect the response

   * Check completeness, depth, balance, factuality, and format. Note gaps (e.g., ethics not covered, impacts not contrasted).

4. Refine the prompt

   * Add missing constraints, context, sections, or examples.
   * Example refinement:
     “Write an informative article on how AI is reshaping the automotive industry. Cover benefits, drawbacks, ethical issues, and both positive and negative impacts. Include autonomous driving and real-time traffic analytics, plus challenges such as algorithmic decision-making and cybersecurity.”

5. Repeat as needed

   * Iterate until the response meets your bar for quality, scope, and style.
 
 
**Common techniques that work well**

* Role prompting: assign the model an expert persona and target audience.
* Few-shot prompting: include 1–3 short, high-quality examples of desired inputs→outputs.
* Structured outputs: request JSON, YAML, or a table with a fixed schema.
* Delimiters: wrap inputs/specs between clear markers (e.g., \`\`\` or <<< >>>) to avoid confusion.
* Constraints and tests: ask for validation rules, unit tests, or checklists the output must pass.
* Decomposition: break a big task into smaller sub-prompts (plan → draft → critique → revise).
* References and citations: ask the model to cite sources or mark uncertain claims (when applicable).

**Quality and safety checks you can ask for**

* “List any assumptions you made and why.”
* “Flag potential biases, privacy concerns, or safety issues.”
* “Provide a short validation checklist the output satisfies.”
* “If information is uncertain or time-sensitive, label it clearly.”

## Generative AI Tools for Model Development


**DataRobot** is an enterprise AI platform that automates the process of building, deploying, and managing machine learning models. It supports a wide range of algorithms and provides a user-friendly interface, available both on cloud and on-premise. The main advantage is its enterprise readiness, speed, and usability. However, it can be expensive for small businesses or individuals. Compared to open-source frameworks, it offers limited customization, and some algorithms behave like a “black box,” which makes interpretability a challenge.

**AutoGluon** is an open-source AutoML library. It simplifies development and deployment through automatic model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and training. It provides useful interpretability features and is free to use. The downsides are that it requires at least basic Python programming knowledge, has fewer customization options compared to more flexible frameworks, and may not scale well to very large or highly complex datasets.

**H2O Driverless AI** is a cloud-based AutoML platform. It focuses on enabling organizations without deep data science expertise to leverage AI. The tool offers an intuitive drag-and-drop interface and built-in interpretability functions that help explain model predictions. However, like DataRobot, it is more suited for enterprises and can be costly for individual users. It is less flexible than open-source alternatives and provides only limited access to underlying code and algorithms.

**Amazon SageMaker Autopilot** is part of AWS’s ecosystem. It fully automates the process of building, training, and deploying models, making it accessible to users with varied skill levels. Its strengths include deep integration with AWS services, seamless data management, and a pay-as-you-go pricing model that is cost-effective for many use cases. The drawbacks are that it creates vendor lock-in, since it ties users to AWS infrastructure, customization is somewhat limited, and the resulting models may still be “black boxes” requiring additional effort to interpret.

**Google Vertex AI** is Google Cloud’s managed machine learning platform. It supports advanced deep learning models, custom algorithms, and includes explainable AI features to make predictions more interpretable. It is highly scalable and powerful for enterprise use. On the downside, it can be complex for beginners as it requires Google Cloud expertise. It can also be expensive because of the intensive use of cloud resources, and it offers only limited support for non-Google ML frameworks.

Beyond these specialized AutoML platforms, **ChatGPT** and **Google Bard** serve as generative AI alternatives for model development. Instead of automating the full end-to-end pipeline, these tools help data scientists by generating scripts and code snippets. For example, with the right prompts, ChatGPT can produce Python code to identify the most important features, fit models such as linear or polynomial regressions, apply ridge regression for evaluation, and run hyperparameter tuning with grid search. These generative AI assistants help even beginner-level practitioners build working prototypes quickly. However, they must not be used verbatim for production work, because copying generated code without modification can be considered plagiarism. Instead, the generated code should serve as a template, to be customized and optimized for the actual application.

**Generative AI for Data Visualization and Storytelling**

Congratulations! You have completed this lesson. At this point in the course, you know:

Generative AI tools can be used to create Python code to perform various operations to draw insights from a given data.

Univariate, bivariate, and multivariate functions are used to analyze data.

Hal9’s free plan generates a statistical representation of the data and finds missing values.

Free generative AI tools can be used to get exploratory insights into the relationship between data variables and create correlation matrices, boxplots, and histograms from data.

Generative AI streamlines the process of creating dashboards by automating intricate design choices.

Some generative AI-driven frameworks to develop dashboards are Dash, ChatGPT, Tableau AI, and Einstein Copilot, Akkio, Thoughtspot, DataSquirrel, and Sisense.

The critical aspects of storytelling in data analytics include data visualization, logical organization, contextualization, engaging your audience, anecdotes and examples, audience-centric approach, and call to action.

Some generative AI-driven frameworks organizations use to create compelling stories include Google Slides with Duet AI, Generative Reports, DesignerBot, ChatGPT, and Google Bard.

While using generative AI models, data scientists need to look into data, model, and ethical considerations.

Data professionals face various challenges when using generative AI in multiple industries.

The challenges can be broadly categorized into technical, organizational, and cultural issues.



## Generative AI for Data Analytics

**What it is (and how it differs from classic AI)**

* Generative AI (GenAI) creates *new* synthetic data or content that resembles real data.
* Unlike traditional predictive/classification models that map inputs → labels or numbers, GenAI can synthesize rows, texts, images, or even queries and code that *fit* a learned distribution.

**Where it helps in analytics (key applications)**

* **Synthetic data creation & augmentation**

  * Expand limited datasets, balance rare classes, run what-if simulations, and reduce direct exposure of sensitive data.
  * Caveat: protect privacy (avoid memorization) and validate that synthetic data preserves important statistical properties without amplifying bias.

* **Missing data imputation**

  * Generate plausible values to fill gaps and produce a more complete analysis dataset.
  * Treat as a model assumption: compare against classical baselines (e.g., multiple imputation) and quantify added uncertainty.

* **Multimodal transformations**

  * Convert text↔image, tables↔narratives, diagrams→code.
  * Useful for re-expressing complex information and for rapid prototyping of UI or report assets.

* **Data preparation (automation of tedious steps)**

  * Assist with cleaning, normalization, deduplication/entity resolution, feature engineering, and schema mapping.
  * Speeds the path from raw data to analysis-ready tables while documenting steps in plain language.

* **Query generation and database interaction**

  * Translate natural language into SQL (or other query languages), optimize joins/filters, and adapt to evolving schemas.
  * Works best with schema/context provided; pair with a safe execution layer (approve before run).

* **Natural-language Q\&A over data**

  * Users ask questions in plain language and receive answers grounded in the data.
  * Often implemented with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG): fetch relevant rows/metrics first, then compose an answer.

* **Visualization and dashboards**

  * Auto-suggest charts, annotate trends/outliers, adapt visuals interactively to user exploration.
  * Modern BI assistants (e.g., in Cognos/Tableau/Looker) can draft visuals, layouts, and narrative summaries.

* **Automated data storytelling**

  * Generate executive narratives that highlight key drivers, caveats, and next steps, turning metrics into readable insights.

**Example end-to-end uses**

* **Rare-event analysis:** generate class-balanced synthetic samples → train model → validate against holdout real data.
* **EDA copilot:** ask for distributions, correlations, anomalies, then request auto-generated code (SQL/Python/R) to reproduce findings.
* **NL→SQL guardrailed workflow:** model proposes SQL → human review → run on read-only warehouse → model explains results and limitations.
* **Instant dashboard draft:** paste a schema and business goals → get a first pass of KPI tiles, charts, and a narrative—then refine.
