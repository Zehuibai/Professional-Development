# Session 2: Synthetic and other baseline covariates: The promise of smaller and faster clinical trials through prognostic digital twins 

## Covariate Adjustment: Traditional principles and challenges by new approaches

**Talk 1: Andreas Brandt (BfArM, EMA)**

## Strategic considerations and value of covariate adjustment

Andreas Brandt's presentation titled "Covariate Adjustment: Traditional Principles and Challenges by New Approaches" delved into both the conventional guidelines and the emerging methods in covariate adjustment, particularly within the context of clinical trials and regulatory analysis. Here's a summary of his talk:

1. **General Guidelines and Principles:**
   - The adjustment of covariates in the primary analysis of clinical trials must be pre-specified, should exclude post-baseline covariates and treatment by covariate interactions.
   - Covariates must be justified based on their strong or moderate association with the primary outcome, which improves the analysis's efficiency.

2. **Guideline Recommendations:**
   - It is advised that no more than a few covariates should be included in the primary analysis to maintain simplicity and ensure numerical stability.
   - The statistical model's assumptions must be validated, especially in generalized linear or nonlinear models, to avoid mis-specifications that could lead to incorrect treatment effect estimates.

3. **Challenges Introduced by New Approaches:**
   - The emergence of big data and artificial intelligence has led to new methods such as borrowing and enriching the study population based on predicted responses.
   - These approaches introduce challenges in controlling external validity and may adjust the study population in ways that could impact the generalizability of the trial results.

4. **PROCOVA Method:**
   - This new method develops a prognostic score for the outcome under control based on historical data independent from the study data. The score is then used to estimate sample size and as a covariate in an ANCOVA model for the new trial.
   - The PROCOVA method aims to enhance power or precision in estimating treatment effects, maintaining type 1 error control and providing unbiased estimates akin to traditional ANCOVA.

5. **Debates and Considerations:**
   - Traditional principles are challenged by the inclusion of synthetic covariates or prognostic scores, which cover information from many covariates and rely on complex models potentially viewed as 'black boxes.'
   - Concerns were raised about the interpretability of treatment effects and subgroup analyses when such synthetic covariates are used.

6. **Transparency and Ethical Considerations:**
   - Proposals to keep the prognostic model confidential while only providing the score to study sponsors were discussed. This raises questions about transparency and the need for stakeholders to understand the model and its implications fully.

Brandt highlighted the ongoing tension between leveraging advanced data-driven methods for enhancing clinical trial efficiency and adhering to traditional principles that prioritize simplicity, transparency, and generalizability. He emphasized the need for a balanced approach that considers both the potential benefits and the inherent risks of new statistical methodologies in clinical research.


**Talk 2: Courtney Schiffman (Genentech Roche)**


Courtney Schiffman's presentation at the EFSPI workshop, titled "Strategic Considerations and Value of Covariate Adjustment," explored the use of covariate adjustment in clinical trials, focusing on enhancing the precision and power of estimating Average Treatment Effects (ATE). Here are the key points from her presentation:

1. **Standardized Estimator**: Schiffman emphasized the value of a standardized estimator, where treatment arm means are estimated using predicted outcomes from a regression model adjusted for baseline covariates. This approach is model-assisted but not model-dependent, ensuring robustness even if the model is misspecified.

2. **Maximizing Data Value**: The use of "super covariates" was discussed—multivariate functions built from independent datasets (e.g., historical trial data) that predict trial outcomes and improve statistical efficiency. This strategy leverages machine learning and other advanced modeling techniques to optimize clinical trials.

3. **Model Simplicity and Performance**: Schiffman advised maintaining a balance between model complexity and performance. She highlighted the importance of developing benchmark models with minimal complexity to ensure that the models are easy to interpret and generalize.

4. **Effective Sample Size Increase (ESSI)**: The presentation detailed how covariate adjustment can effectively increase sample size, quantifying the precision and power gains equivalent to running a larger trial. The ESSI metric helps in determining the added value of covariate adjustment under different treatment effect scenarios.

5. **Strategies for Model Formulation**: Practical advice was given on determining the form of the working regression model, including the prioritization of covariates based on their prognostic value and keeping the model budget within 5-7% of the total sample size to avoid overfitting.

6. **Regulatory Considerations**: Schiffman noted the regulatory perspective on using advanced covariate adjustment methods, including the importance of building models on data external to the trial and ensuring that the models are pre-specified and locked before trial unblinding.

7. **Practical Application and Examples**: The talk included examples from ophthalmology, where models predicting disease progression were used to adjust trial outcomes, significantly increasing the trial's effective sample size.

Overall, Schiffman's presentation underscored the strategic importance of covariate adjustment in clinical trials, highlighting its potential to increase efficiency and precision in estimating treatment effects while adhering to regulatory standards and ensuring model interpretability.

### Synthetic Covariates {-}

Synthetic covariates in the context of clinical trials are essentially engineered or constructed variables derived from one or more existing variables within the dataset. These covariates are typically designed to capture underlying patterns or prognostic factors that might influence the outcome of a study. Here’s a more detailed exploration of synthetic covariates, including their creation, use, and benefits:
 
Synthetic covariates are created using statistical or machine learning methods that combine various baseline characteristics into a single predictive score or index. This process often involves:

1. **Data Integration**: Combining data from various sources, such as historical trials, observational studies, or electronic health records, to develop a robust model.
2. **Model Development**: Using techniques such as regression analysis, principal component analysis, or more complex machine learning algorithms like random forests or neural networks to develop a model that predicts an outcome or a relevant factor (like disease severity) from baseline variables.
3. **Validation**: Validating the synthetic covariate with independent data sets to ensure it generalizes well across different populations or settings.
 
Synthetic covariates are employed in clinical trials primarily to increase the statistical power and precision of the estimates. Their uses include:

- **Adjusting for Baseline Imbalances**: Even in randomized trials, there can be imbalances in baseline characteristics. Adjusting for synthetic covariates that capture these characteristics can reduce bias.
- **Increasing Efficiency**: By accounting for variation in baseline characteristics, synthetic covariates can reduce the residual error, thus increasing the trial's efficiency.
- **Improving Predictive Accuracy**: They can be used to better predict patient outcomes, which is particularly useful in trials targeting complex diseases where multiple factors influence the response to treatment.
 
The benefits of using synthetic covariates include:

- **Enhanced Precision**: By accounting for multiple prognostic factors in a single variable, synthetic covariates can sharpen the estimates of treatment effects, reducing the standard error.
- **Reduced Sample Size Requirements**: With enhanced precision, the required sample size to detect a given effect size can be smaller, potentially reducing the duration and cost of clinical trials.
- **Improved Handling of High-dimensional Data**: In situations where there are many baseline covariates relative to the number of participants (high-dimensional settings), synthetic covariates can simplify the model by reducing dimensionality.
 
While synthetic covariates can be highly beneficial, they also present challenges:

- **Complexity in Interpretation**: Because they are combinations of multiple variables, it can be challenging to interpret how each component contributes to the overall effect.
- **Risk of Overfitting**: Especially in the case of machine learning-based covariates, there's a risk that the model could fit the noise in the training data rather than the underlying pattern, leading to poor performance on new data.
- **Regulatory Acceptance**: There may be concerns from regulatory bodies about the transparency and reproducibility of the methods used to create and validate synthetic covariates.
 
To address potential regulatory concerns, it is crucial that synthetic covariates are:
- **Transparently Reported**: Clear documentation of how the covariates were created, validated, and implemented.
- **Pre-specified in Trial Protocols**: Synthetic covariates should be defined before the trial commences and included in the statistical analysis plan.
- **Subject to Sensitivity Analyses**: Analyses demonstrating that the conclusions of the trial are robust to different methods of covariate adjustment.

In summary, synthetic covariates can offer significant advantages in clinical trials by enhancing the efficiency and precision of statistical analyses. However, their design and implementation must be carefully managed to ensure they are both effective and acceptable to regulatory authorities.



## Adjusting for covariates in randomized clinical trials for drugs and biological products

**Talk 3: FDA/CDER/OTS/OB/DBIV Daniel Rubin, Ph.D. - virtually**

Daniel Rubin's presentation, hosted by the FDA/CDER/OTS/OB/DBIV, centered on the updated guidelines and strategic applications of covariate adjustment in randomized clinical trials for drugs and biological products. Here’s a summary of his key points:

1. **Updated Guidance Overview**:
   - The new FDA guidance released in May 2023 incorporates various updates from the 2021 draft, introducing topics such as alignment with the ICH estimand framework, sample size calculations, and the use of inverse probability weighting. The guidance emphasizes the importance of precise covariate adjustment methods, offering additional details and referenced methods for improved clarity and utility in clinical trials.

2. **General Considerations for Covariate Adjustment**:
   - Rubin stressed that covariate adjustment is acceptable when pre-specified, which includes detailing which covariates will be included in the adjustment model. The number of covariates should be carefully selected to avoid overfitting, and any stratified randomization should be appropriately accounted for, especially in change from baseline analyses.

3. **Linear Models**:
   - In the context of linear models, such as ANCOVA, the presentation underscored that these models could estimate the average treatment effect robustly, even if the model is misspecified. This allows for valid inference using robust standard errors and the inclusion of treatment by covariate interactions when necessary.

4. **Collapsibility and Non-linear Models**:
   - With non-linear models like logistic or Cox proportional hazards models, population-level summaries can be non-collapsible even in randomized settings. Rubin outlined the differences between conditional and unconditional treatment effects, which need to be explicitly defined in the trial's statistical analysis plan.

5. **Unconditional Treatment Effects in Non-linear Models**:
   - For unconditional treatment effects, covariate adjustment can decrease standard errors and enhance the power of the trial. Methods to estimate these effects should provide valid inference under minimal statistical assumptions, similar to those needed for unadjusted estimation.

6. **Data Adaptive Covariate Adjustment**:
   - The presentation also covered advanced topics such as data-adaptive covariate selection and adjustment in adaptive trial designs. Rubin mentioned that when using machine learning methods to form a prognostic index from external studies, the resulting covariate adjustment could inherit properties of valid inference even if the machine learning method itself is a "black box."
 






# Session 3: Complex innovative trials for regulatory decision-making

## Some guidance on when applying adaptive designs

**Talk 1: Khadija Rantell (MHRA), Frank Bretz (Novartis), Hans Ulrich Burger (Roche)**

Khadija Rantell, Frank Bretz, and Hans Ulrich Burger discussed the strategic considerations for applying adaptive designs in clinical trials during their talk at the EFSPI workshop. Here are the key points and implications for drug trials as covered in their presentation:

**Understanding Adaptive Designs:**
Adaptive designs allow for prospectively planned modifications based on accumulating data. This flexibility is particularly useful in both exploratory and confirmatory clinical trials, enabling researchers to make informed changes to the trial design as new data becomes available.

**Motivations for Using Adaptive Designs:**
The primary motivation for using adaptive designs is to address uncertainties that are difficult to predict before the trial starts, such as optimal dosing, target populations, or outcome variability. Adaptive designs can lead to more efficient trials by potentially decreasing the time to completion, reducing resource requirements, and limiting the number of patients exposed to potentially less effective treatments.

**Common Types of Adaptive Designs:**
- **Sample Size Reassessment:** Adjustments to sample size based on interim data to ensure sufficient power to detect treatment effects.
- **Interim Analyses:** Early termination for futility or efficacy can save resources and protect patients.
- **Response Adaptive Randomization:** Adjusting the allocation ratio based on accumulated responses to direct more participants to promising treatments.
- **Adaptive Enrichment:** Modifying enrollment criteria to target populations where the intervention is more likely to be effective.
- **Seamless Designs:** Combining phases of clinical development to streamline the process.

**Principles for Implementing Adaptive Designs:**
- **Justification:** The use of adaptive designs should be justified with clear scientific principles to ensure they are appropriate for the trial’s objectives.
- **Pre-specification:** Detailed planning is crucial, including pre-specifying the number and timing of interim analyses, the type of adaptations planned, and the rules governing these adaptations.
- **Maintaining Trial Integrity:** It is vital to limit the disclosure of interim results to avoid biases and maintain the integrity of the trial.
- **Independent Data Monitoring Committee:** Often necessary in adaptive trials to oversee the safety of the trial and the validity of the data.

**Regulatory Considerations:**
- The design and implementation of adaptive trials must align with regulatory expectations, particularly regarding the control of type I error and the reliability of estimations.
- Engagements with regulatory bodies are encouraged early in the trial design process to ensure that the adaptive aspects of the trial are well understood and accepted.

**Implications for Drug Trials:**
Adaptive designs offer several advantages that can be particularly beneficial in the context of drug development:

## Tips on a) what questions to ask regulators and HTAs, b) interpreting the answers given and c) what to do when different authorities give conflicting advice

**Talk 3: David Wright (AstraZeneca)**

David Wright from AstraZeneca shared insights on engaging effectively with regulators and HTAs, focusing on what questions to ask, how to interpret the answers, and how to handle conflicting advice from different authorities. Here’s a detailed breakdown of the tips he provided:

**What Questions to Ask Regulators and HTAs**
- **Be Part of the Team:** Engage comprehensively, not just on statistical questions. Understand the clinical objectives fully to ensure the primary estimand chosen is appropriate.
- **Be Precise and Concise:** Ask focused questions to avoid vague answers. Limit the number of questions to ensure each receives adequate attention and detailed responses.
- **Relevant Statistical Questions:** Focus questions on major issues related to the primary estimand rather than speculative or minor statistical methods.

**Interpreting the Answers Given**
- **Form Your Own Opinion:** Review the regulatory responses personally before discussing them within the team to ensure a clear understanding of the advice.
- **Avoid Overinterpretation:** Don’t infer agreement on unaddressed issues or bend interpretations to fit preconceived desires or outcomes. If something was not mentioned, do not assume it was approved or agreed upon.

**Handling Conflicting Advice**
- **Don’t Panic:** Start by verifying if the advice truly conflicts and whether the discrepancies are significant enough to impact study design or the overall clinical program.
- **Clarify Differences:** Understand whether differences are fundamental or minor. Fundamental differences might require major design changes, while minor ones could be more about optimization.
- **Develop a Feasible Plan:** Attempt to devise a clinical development strategy that accommodates the advice from all bodies, if possible. If conflicts are irresolvable, assess the risks of not following one authority’s advice over another.

**General Tips**
- **Transparency and Collaboration:** Be transparent with your questions and provide complete information to facilitate precise advice. Work closely with your team to align on the strategy and the questions to be asked.
- **Use of Estimand Framework:** Employ this framework to ensure clarity and alignment on the clinical questions and objectives, which will help in framing the right questions and interpreting responses effectively.
- **Prepare for Different Outcomes:** Be prepared for varying opinions and ensure that your development plan can adapt to different regulatory expectations.



# Session 5: Use of non-RCT studies in regulatory decision-making

## Single Arm Trials: The EMA Reflection Paper

**Talk 1: Kit Roes (Radboud Universiteit, EMA)**

Kit Roes' presentation focused on the EMA Reflection Paper regarding the use of single-arm trials (SATs) as pivotal evidence for marketing authorizations. Here are the key points discussed:

Motivation for the Reflection Paper:
- A significant proportion of marketing authorization submissions, particularly for rare diseases, are based on data from single-arm trials. These submissions present challenges in terms of regulatory assessment.
- The paper aims to communicate these challenges and provide guidance to improve the design, conduct, and interpretation of SATs.

Purpose and Scope:
- The paper focuses on methodological considerations for SATs submitted as pivotal evidence. It addresses key issues related to efficacy evaluation in SATs, including design, conduct, and assessment.
- It does not cover specific therapeutic areas, safety considerations, or detailed guidance on the use of external controls.

Key Deficiencies of SATs:
- Lack of Randomization: SATs do not involve randomization or a concurrent control group, leading to significant biases.
- No Blinding: Patients, investigators, and assessors are not blinded, which introduces further bias.
- No Causal Interpretation: Without randomization, establishing a causal relationship between the treatment and observed outcomes is difficult. SATs rely heavily on assumptions and external information.

Key Methodological Considerations:
1. Internal and External Validity:
   - SATs lack internal comparators, making it difficult to assess treatment effects in a way that mimics randomized controlled trials (RCTs).
   - External validity is compromised because SAT results may not generalize well to broader populations, especially when prognostic variables differ between the trial population and the target population.
   
2. Isolation of Treatment Effect:
   - Establishing a treatment effect in SATs is challenging because it requires external information or assumptions to act as a counterfactual. Residual uncertainty often remains, even with strong qualitative reasoning.

3. Quantification of Uncertainty:
   - Confidence intervals should be used to quantify uncertainty in treatment effect estimates, but this is difficult because the true counterfactual is not observed. Threshold-based approaches may underestimate variability.

4. Endpoint Selection:
   - Choosing endpoints is crucial. Time-to-event endpoints are generally difficult in SATs due to disease progression, treatment initiation points, and prognostic factors. Continuous endpoints also face challenges due to variability and measurement error.
   
5. Use of External Information:
   - External clinical data or knowledge about the disease’s natural history is essential for interpreting SATs. However, this information should be treated as supporting evidence, not definitive proof of efficacy.

Biases and Remedies:
- The presentation highlighted several types of biases associated with SATs, including selection bias, regression to the mean, attrition bias, and immortal time bias. Remedies involve meticulous pre-planning, pre-specification of endpoints and thresholds, and careful selection of the trial population.

Statistical Principles:
- Standards for SATs in confirmatory settings must adhere to rigorous statistical principles, including pre-specified success criteria, appropriate handling of multiplicity, and comprehensive analysis sets.

Recommendations:
- SATs should seek scientific advice from regulatory bodies, especially regarding the use of external information and assumptions.
- Proper statistical modeling and pre-specification are essential to reduce the risk of overestimating clinical benefit in SATs.

In summary, the EMA’s reflection paper emphasizes that while single-arm trials can play a role in regulatory submissions, particularly for rare diseases, they present significant methodological challenges. Careful design, the use of external information, and rigorous statistical approaches are critical to ensuring that the results from SATs are reliable and interpretable.

Emmanuel Zuber from Novartis discussed the use of external controls for regulatory approval and labeling, focusing on two case studies. Here's a detailed overview of the key points he covered:

**Overview of External Controls:**
- External controls are utilized in non-randomized controlled trial (RCT) decision-making settings to enhance the robustness and efficiency of the evaluation. Though not new, their application in approval and labeling processes poses unique challenges.
- Zuber emphasized the need for clear regulatory guidance to maintain high standards of evidence in decisions involving external controls.

**Case Study 1: Kymriah in Follicular Lymphoma**
- **Background**: Kymriah, a CAR-T cell therapy, was evaluated for use in patients with relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma after at least two lines of therapy.
- **Trial Design**: A single-arm trial (SAT) named ELARA was conducted. The EMA and FDA gave parallel scientific advice, acknowledging the unmet medical need and the potential basis of a SAT for licensure due to the promising, albeit limited, data.
- **Regulatory Feedback**: Questions from EMA rapporteurs during protocol review emphasized the need for a compelling level of efficacy to justify the use of external controls. The FDA’s feedback highlighted the potential insufficiency of real-world data (RWD) for traditional approval.

**Case Study 2: Promacta in Severe Aplastic Anemia**
- **Background**: Promacta, aimed at treating patients with severe aplastic anemia, especially those unsuitable for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.
- **Trial Design**: The trial examined the efficacy of Promacta combined with standard immunosuppressive therapy. The single-arm study design faced scrutiny regarding its ability to isolate the treatment effect without a comparator.
- **Regulatory Feedback**: The FDA and EMA both stressed the necessity of a comparator to robustly assess efficacy. External controls were suggested as a means to supplement the SAT, providing a historical comparison but requiring careful selection and analysis to ensure validity.

**General Considerations and Recommendations:**
- **Learning from Interactions**: Both case studies provided insights into navigating regulatory interactions, emphasizing the importance of understanding and addressing regulatory expectations clearly and early in the drug development process.
- **Challenges with External Controls**: External controls must convincingly demonstrate treatment effects when RCTs are not feasible. This involves ensuring the external data are of high quality and appropriately matched to the trial population.
- **Regulatory Outcomes**: The discussions around external controls revealed their potential to support approval when RCTs are not feasible but also highlighted the complexities and uncertainties involved in using these controls effectively.

**Conclusion:**
- The application of external controls in regulatory approval and labeling is still evolving, with a learning curve for all stakeholders. Early guidance and clear communication with regulatory bodies are crucial to ensure that submissions using external controls are complete, focused, and adequately address areas of uncertainty.

In essence, Zuber's presentation underscored the nuanced considerations necessary when integrating external controls into the regulatory approval process, stressing the importance of strategic planning and regulatory dialogue to optimize the use of these controls.


## HTA view on the EMA draft reflection paper and the FDA guidance 

**Talk 4: PD Dr Med Stefan Lange (IQWiG)**

Dr. Stefan Lange provided an HTA perspective on the EMA draft reflection paper and the FDA guidance regarding the use of single-arm trials (SATs) and external controls. Here's a detailed overview of his presentation:

**HTA Approach to Drug Assessment:**
- HTAs focus on a broader set of outcomes than typical regulatory evaluations, including comparative effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. The HTA perspective emphasizes the need for direct comparison with standard care, including non-drug interventions and best supportive care.

**EMA Reflection Paper on SATs:**
- The EMA paper stresses that it's the responsibility of the applicant to justify the use of an SAT when it deviates from the standard RCT approach. SATs must convincingly demonstrate efficacy to be considered as pivotal evidence.
- The paper notes the importance of selecting primary endpoints that can isolate treatment effects, indicating that these should be outcomes unlikely to occur without active treatment. This stringent requirement typically applies to more than one endpoint in HTA evaluations.

**FDA Guidance on Externally Controlled Trials:**
- The FDA guidance discusses the need to pre-specify plans for measuring and analyzing data on important confounding factors and biases, highlighting the complexity of using external controls in regulatory submissions.
- The guidance also addresses the challenges of documenting data in routine clinical care, which may lack comprehensive details required for robust trial comparisons.

**HTA's View on Regulatory Guidelines:**
- Dr. Lange highlighted that while both the EMA and FDA provide frameworks for considering SATs and external controls, these are typically viewed by HTAs as suitable only in rare exceptional cases due to the high risk of bias and the difficulty in ensuring comparable populations.
- The HTA perspective is particularly cautious about the ability of non-randomized data to provide convincing evidence of comparative effectiveness, stressing the need for high-quality data and rigorous confounder adjustment.

**Challenges Highlighted by HTA:**
- The inherent biases and data quality issues in SATs and studies using external controls make it challenging to meet the HTA requirements for clear, unbiased evidence of effectiveness.
- HTAs require that the data used in analyses have the same level of rigor as that expected in randomized pivotal trials, which is often not achievable with external controls.

**Concluding Thoughts:**
- Dr. Lange emphasized that using non-randomized trial data as compelling evidence for comparative effectiveness is often resource-intensive and potentially resource-wasting. He suggests that in many situations, the likelihood of credibly demonstrating effectiveness with an external control is low, and sponsors should consider more suitable trial designs.

In summary, the HTA perspective, as presented by Dr. Lange, is one of caution and skepticism regarding the sufficiency of SATs and external controls for providing the level of evidence needed to support comparative effectiveness claims, particularly in the context of health technology assessments.
