# Python for Genomic Data Science

[Certificate] (https://github.com/lanttern/Genomic-Data-Science/blob/master/Course3_Python%20for%20Genomic%20Data%20Science/images/Coursera%20genpython%202015.pdf)

#### Part of the Genomic Data Science Specialization

This class provides an introduction to the Python programming language and the iPython notebook. This is the third course in the Genomic Big Data Science Specialization from Johns Hopkins University.

#### About the Course
This class will provide an introduction to the Python programming language to people who are not computer scientists but who want to analyze genomic data. The course will teach participants basic concepts of bioinformatics programming, and introduce them to computational tools that deal with large amounts of data. The goals of the class is to enable students to write basic programs in Python, to adapt existing programs to their needs, and to interface Python programs with various bioinformatics packages through the use of Biopython. This course has a $99 value but being offered at a significant discount.

#### Project - Develop Python Bioinformatics Tools to Analyze DNA Sequence 

In this project, a python program that takes as input a file containing DNA sequences in multi-FASTA format was developed. The program includes a set of tools for dna sequence analyses (a. check records in file (count_records), b. compute the length of each DNA sequence (check_length), c. identify open read frame in each DNA sequence (orf_identifier), d. identify repeated motif in sequence (repeats_identifier)). To use the tool  sets, please assign the path and file name to the class function. For example: dna_tools = dna_tool_sets ("../data/dna.example.fasta"). Then, call the functions in the class, e.g call function to check length of dna sequence: length = dna_tools.check_length()
