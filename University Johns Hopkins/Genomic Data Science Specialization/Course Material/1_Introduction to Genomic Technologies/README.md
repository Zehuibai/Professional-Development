#### Part of the Genomic Data Science Specialization
The basic biology of modern genomics and the experimental tools used for measurement. This is the first course in the Genomic Big Data Science Specialization.


#### About the Course
This course introduces you to the basic biology of modern genomics and the experimental tools used to measure this biology. The course will introduce the Central Dogma of Molecular Biology and cover how next generation sequencing can be used to measure DNA, RNA, and epigenetics. The course will also give a brief introduction to the key concepts in computing and statistics that you will need to understand how data from next generation sequencing are generated and analyzed.

#### Course Syllabus
1. The Central Dogma of Molecular Biology

2. How next generation sequencing works

3. Applications of next generation sequencing to measure

    - DNA

    - RNA
    
    - Epigenetics (e.g. DNA methylation)

4. Basic concepts in computing on next generation sequencing data
    
    - What is an algorithm? 

    - What is a data structure?

    - How to share data? 

5. Basic concepts in statistics for next generation sequencing

    - Types of variation (biological, technological)
    
    - Experimental design
    
    - Signal and noise

#### Project

In this project you will be reading a genomic data science paper and answering some questions
to help you learn about how the different fields in genomic data science work together and to
evaluate your understanding of some of the concepts we have learned throughout the course.
The paper we are reading is called: “Microbial Genes in the Human Genome: Lateral Transfer or
Gene Loss?” You can access the paper from the Science Magazine site here:
http://www.sciencemag.org/content/292/5523/1903.full.
