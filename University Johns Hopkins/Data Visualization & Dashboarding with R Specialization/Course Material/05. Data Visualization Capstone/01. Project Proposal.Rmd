## 📊 Project Topic

My project will be an **analysis of the 2016 Summer Olympic Games** in *Rio de Janeiro*.
The goal is to assess the **performance of athletes** based on various characteristics.

I will measure:

* 🥇 Gold
* 🥈 Silver
* 🥉 Bronze medals

…achieved across the following variables:

* Sport
* Nationality
* Gender
* Age
* Height
* Weight

## 🔗 Data Sources

**Primary Source:**
[https://github.com/flother/rio2016](https://github.com/flother/rio2016)

This dataset is a web-scraped copy of the official **2016 Olympic Games athlete statistics** originally published on the Rio 2016 website by the **International Olympic Committee (IOC)**.

> ⚠️ Note: The official Rio 2016 site has since been taken down, but this data has been preserved by GitHub user [@flother](https://github.com/flother).

**Verification:**
Similar data is still available (though less structured) at the IOC's official results portal:
[https://www.olympic.org/olympic-results?g=Rio%202016](https://www.olympic.org/olympic-results?g=Rio%202016)

## 📄 Description of the Data

* **Total Athletes:** 11,538
* **Total Events:** 306
* **Format:** Tidy rectangular format (one row per athlete)
* **Variables Include:**

  * Nationality (`country`)
  * Sex (`gender`)
  * Date of Birth (`dob`)
  * Height
  * Weight
  * Sport/Event
  * Medal indicators (Gold / Silver / Bronze)

> 💡 Although it's recommended to use datasets with fewer than 10,000 rows, this dataset slightly exceeds that limit—but remains manageable.

## 📈 Visualization Ideas

**🟠 Idea 1:**
**Scatter Plot** – Total Athletes per Country vs. Total Medals per Country

> *Do countries with more athletes win more medals?*

---

**🟣 Idea 2:**
**Stacked Bar Chart** – Number of Medals per Sport, broken down by Gender

> *Which sporting events offer the most medals? Are some events gender-exclusive?*

---

**🔵 Idea 3:**
**Bubble Scatter Plot** – Weight vs. Height, bubble size = number of medals

> *Do taller or heavier athletes tend to win more medals?*
