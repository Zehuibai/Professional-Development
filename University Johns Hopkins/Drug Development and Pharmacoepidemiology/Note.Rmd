# Drug Development and Regulation: From Bench to Bedside



## Overview of Drug Development and Approval Process

**Five Key Steps in Drug Development**

1. **Discovery & Development**

   * Identify promising molecules by understanding the disease and biological targets.
   * Screen thousands of compounds; only \~10‚Äì20 progress.
   * Study absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion (ADME), mechanism, dosage, effectiveness, and toxicity.

2. **Preclinical Research**

   * Conduct *in vitro* (test tube) and *in vivo* (animal) studies focusing on safety/toxicity.
   * Follow Good Laboratory Practices (GLP).
   * Submit **Investigational New Drug Application (IND)** to FDA, including animal data, manufacturing info, and clinical protocols.
   * FDA reviews within 30 days before allowing human testing.

3. **Clinical Research**

   * **Phase 1**: 20‚Äì100 participants, mainly healthy volunteers, to assess safety & dosage.
   * **Phase 2**: Hundreds of patients with the target disease; assess efficacy & side effects.
   * **Phase 3**: 300‚Äì3,000 patients; confirm efficacy, monitor adverse reactions (pivotal trials).
   * If successful ‚Üí submit **New Drug Application (NDA)**.

4. **FDA Drug Review**

   * FDA has 60 days to accept NDA for review.
   * Review takes \~6‚Äì10 months; may consult advisory committees.
   * Inspect manufacturing facilities and review labeling.

5. **Post-Marketing Safety Monitoring**

   * Ongoing surveillance for rare/long-term side effects.
   * Programs include **MedWatch** and **Sentinel Initiative**.

**FDA Programs to Accelerate Access**

* **Fast Track** ‚Äì expedite development/review for serious conditions with unmet needs.
* **Breakthrough Therapy Designation** ‚Äì for drugs showing substantial improvement over existing therapies.
* **Accelerated Approval** ‚Äì approve based on surrogate endpoints for serious conditions.
* **Priority Review** ‚Äì FDA decision within 6 months (vs. standard 10).

‚è≥ **Typical Timeline**: 10‚Äì15 years from discovery to approval.
üîç **Key Theme**: Balancing speed, safety, and efficacy through regulated, stepwise evaluation.
 
 
## Role of Regulatory Agencies Around the World for Drug Approval

 
**Main Purpose of Regulatory Agencies**

* Goal: Protect public health by ensuring medications are **safe**, **effective**, and of **high quality**.
* Despite differences in demographics, economics, and healthcare systems, agencies share this mission.

**Key Regulatory Agencies Worldwide**

* **USA**: Food and Drug Administration (**FDA**)
* **Canada**: Health Canada
* **Nigeria**: National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (**NAFDAC**)
* **Europe**: European Medicines Agency (**EMA**)
* **Global Coordination**: International Council for Harmonisation (**ICH**) ‚Äî develops globally accepted guidelines for harmonizing drug development, registration, and quality standards.

**FDA vs EMA**

*Similarities*

1. Shared Mission ‚Äì Protect public health.
2. Approval Role ‚Äì Approve/reject new drugs and medical devices.
3. Guidelines ‚Äì Set regulatory standards for drug development, manufacturing, and marketing.
4. Post-Marketing Surveillance ‚Äì Monitor adverse events, inspect facilities, require risk management plans.

*Differences*

1. Jurisdiction ‚Äì FDA: U.S. only; EMA: EU-wide.
2. Structure ‚Äì FDA is centralized; EMA is decentralized, working with each EU member state‚Äôs authority.
3. Decision Authority ‚Äì FDA makes the final approval decision; EMA recommends; final decision by **European Commission**.
4. Access to Non-Published Data ‚Äì FDA makes it public; EMA treats it as sensitive and does not publish.

**Concordance Between FDA and EMA**

* Study (2014‚Äì2016): 107 drug applications reviewed by both ‚Üí **98% concordance** in final decisions.
* Main cause of disagreement: Differences in interpretation of **efficacy data**.

*Examples of Divergence*

* **Abaloparatide** (osteoporosis): FDA approved 2017; EMA rejected 2019 (insufficient efficacy evidence, cardiac safety concerns) ‚Üí approved in 2022.
* **Ataluren** (muscular dystrophy): EMA approved 2014; FDA not approved (insufficient efficacy evidence).
